<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I’m Qaasid Bajwa, a junior studying Computer Engineering with a passion for problem-solving, technology, and fitness. Whether it’s optimizing transportation systems, building innovative projects, or pushing my physical limits, I’m always striving for growth.</p>
<h2>Engineering & Tech</h2>
<p>I’ve worked on projects like StrideSense, a smart shoe sole designed to help people with foot imbalances, and the GTFS Pathway Generator, which focused on improving NJ Transit’s efficiency. My interests lie in AI, machine learning, data science, and embedded systems, and I’m constantly exploring new ways to merge technology with real-world applications.</p>
<h2>Fitness & Sports</h2>
<p>Outside of coding and engineering, I’m dedicated to strength training, calisthenics, and endurance sports. I bike 11 miles daily, run regularly, and play soccer weekly. My current goals? Increasing my running speed, build muscle, and eventually dunking a basketball.</p>
<h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
<li>Learning full-stack web development, AI, and machine learning.</li>
<li>Improving my circuit analysis and hardware skills.</li>
<li>Training for long-distance running and vertical jump improvements.</li>
<li>Exploring MTA scheduling optimization to improve train efficiency.</li>
